# SAMS TEACH YOURSELF C IN 24HRS

## What you will learn in 24 hours

Teach Yourself C in 24 Hours consists of five parts.

### Part I: The Basics of C

you’ll learn the basics of the C language. Here is a summary of what you’re going to learn:

- Hour 1, “Taking the First Step,”
Introduces you to the C language, the ANSI stan- dard, and the basic software and hardware requirements for C programming.

- Hour 2, “Your First C Program,”
Demonstrates the entire procedure of writing, compiling, linking, and running a C program.

- Hour 3, “Learning the Structure of a C Program,” teaches you several important concepts, such as constants, variables, expressions, and statements. The anatomy of a function is introduced in this hour as well.

- Hour 4, “Understanding Data Types and Keywords,” lists all reserved C keywords. Four data types, char, int, float, and double, are introduced in detail. Also, the rules for naming a variable are explained.

- Hour 5, “Handling Standard Input and Output,” teaches you to receive input from the keyboard, and print output on the screen with the help of a set of C functions, such as getc(), getchar(), putc(), putchar(), and printf().

### Part II: Operators and Control-flow Statements

emphasizes operators and control-flow statements in C. The following is a summary of what you’ll learn:

- Hour 6, “Manipulating Data,” teaches you how to use arithmetic assignment opera- tors, the unary minus operator, increment/decrement operators, relational operators, and the cast operator.

- Hour 7, “Working with Loops,” introduces looping (that is, iteration) with the for, while, or do-while statements.

- Hour 8, “Using Conditional Operators,” tells you about more operators, such as logical operators, bitwise operators, the sizeof operator, and ?: operator, which are frequently used in C.

- Hour 9, “Working with Data Modifiers and Math Functions,” describes how to use data modifiers to enable or disable the sign bit, or change the size of a data type. Also, several mathematical functions provided by C are introduced.

- Hour 10, “Controlling Program Flow,” introduces all the control-flow statements used in C. They are the if, if-else, switch, break, continue, and goto statements.

### Part III: Pointers and Arrays

The following is a summary of what you’ll learn:

- Hour 11, “Understanding Pointers,” teaches you how to reference variables with pointers. Concepts such as left value and right value are also introduced.

- Hour 12, “Understanding Arrays,” explains how to declare and initialize arrays. The relationship between the array and the pointer in C is discussed too.

- Hour 13, “Manipulating Strings” focuses on reading and writing strings. Several C library functions, such as strlen(), strcpy(), gets(), puts(), and scanf(), are introduced to manipulate strings.

- Hour 14, “Understanding Scope and Storage Classes,” introduces block scope, func- tion scope, program scope, and file scope. In addition, storage class specifiers or modi- fiers, such as auto, static, register, extern, const, and volatile are explained.

### Part IV: Functions and Dynamic Memory Allocation

Focuses on functions and dynamic memory allocations in C. The following is a summary of what you’ll learn:

- Hour 15, “Working with Functions,” describes the function declaration and defini- tion in C. The function prototyping is explained, along with the function return type specification.

- Hour 16, “Applying Pointers” teaches you how to perform pointer arithmetic opera- tions, access elements in arrays with pointers, and how to pass pointers to functions.

- Hour 17, “Allocating Memory” explains the concept of allocating memory dynami- cally. C functions, such as malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), and free(), are intro- duced with regard to the dynamic memory allocation.

- Hour 18, “Using Special Data Types and Functions,” introduces the enum data type and the use of typedef. Function recursion and command-line arguments to the main() function are also taught in Hour 18.

### Part V: Structure, Union, File I/O, and More discusses structures, unions, and disk file I/O in C

The following is a summary of what you’ll learn:

- Hour 19, “Understanding Structures,” introduces the structure data type. You learn to access structure members, and pass structures to functions with the help of pointers. Nested and forward-referencing structures are also discussed in this hour.

- Hour 20, “Understanding Unions,” describes the union data type, and the difference between union and structure. The applications of unions are demonstrated in several examples.

- Hour 21, “Reading and Writing with Files,” explains the concepts of the file and the stream in C. The basics of disk file input and output are introduced in this first part. The following C functions, along with several examples are, introduced in this hour: fopen(), fclose(), fgetc(), fputc(), fgets(), fputs(), fread(), fwrite(), and feof().

- Hour 22, “Using Special File Functions,” is the second part of disk file I/O, in which fseek(), ftell(), and rewind() are introduced to show how they can help you to get random access to disk files. In addition, the fscanf(), fprintf(), and freopen() functions are taught and invoked in sample programs.

- Hour 23, “Compiling Programs: The C Preprocessor,” describes the role played by the C preprocessor. You can learn the preprocessor directives, such as #define, #undef, #ifdef, #endif, #ifndef, #if, #elis, and #else through the examples given in this hour.

- Hour 24, “Where Do You Go from Here?,” summarizes the important concepts and features introduced in this book. In addition, programming style, modular program- ming, and debugging are explained briefly. A list of recommended C books is pro- vided for your further reading.
